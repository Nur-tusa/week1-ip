<div class="bio">
    I was born on a warm, sunny day in June in nairobi, KENYA. I still live in
nairobi, KENYA, and I go to school at Eastleigh High School. I live with my
mom,abdul; my brother, hussein; and my Aunt Molly. When I was born, my bother
was fifteen-months-old and hid under the table from me. Jake is a sweet kid and
he would do anything for me, but like all brothers and sisters we fight like cats
and dogs. Sometimes when no one was around, Jake would come up to me and
bite my toes for no reason. I still love him but only because he is my brother.
Who I amin life.
My name is Sally Friday. I started school whenI was six-years-old. I went to
kindergarten through fifth grade at Booker Elementary and while I was there, I
won an award for perfect attendance. Ialso won an award for honor roll all four
terms. ThenI attended Booker Middle School, and therel also won a couple of
a wards: one for perfect attendance and two for being named Student of the
Year-one in sixth grade and the other in eighth grade. I am now a senior at
Booker High School.I plan on finishing school and maybe going to a
community college.
Whatlifemeans to mne.
Life to me means friends and family who you can trust and who trusts you. I am
pretty much on the happy side of life, but like all teens I do I have my "days of."
That means I do have some sad days or depressed days. I have a few frinds here
that sort of look out for me and when I am having a bad day, I have someone here at school to talk to. I make my school days go by thinking of either the next
hour or what I will do when I get home or on the weekend. I'm not seeing
anyone now but when I did have a boytriend, our favorite places to go were the
movies and out to dinner. Sometimes we went to the beach. Only once we went
to an amusement park: Universal Studios. We were together for fwenty-ine days and then we broke-up; so no, I don't think it was forever.
