        <strong> <h2>lion</h2></strong> 
            
       <p>  <b><i>  (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
             It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and
              a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
              adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. 
              It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
               consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female 
               lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and 
               keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known 
               to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</i></b> </p>

         <i> <strong> <h2>tiger</h2></strong>  
           <p> 
            <b><i>(Panthera tigris)</i> is the largest living cat species and 
            a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its
             dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. 
             It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and 
             wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
              requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements
               for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about 
               two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to
                establish their own.</b></p></i>

          <b> <i> <strong > <h2>Monkey</h2></strong> 
         <p>    is a common name that may refer to most simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes.
             Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys 
             except the apes; in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes may also be included,
              making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. 
              Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys
               (which again include apes in the broader sense as parvorder Catarrhini, 
               but not in the stricter sense as family Cercopithecidae).</i></b>

         <h2>Zebras</h2> 
         <p>    <b>(subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white
             striped coats. There are three extant species: the Gr√©vy's zebra (Equus grevyi),
              plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). 
              Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups
               being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come 
               in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been 
               proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them 
               as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa 
               and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, 
               shrublands, and mountainous areas.</p></b>

       <br> <h2>Gorillas</h2>  </br>
          <p>     <b>are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit 
            the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided 
            into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four 
            or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, 
            from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living 
            relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</b>
